# Routing-Protocols
This project features a single, consistent network topology designed in Cisco Packet Tracer, configured separately using three dynamic routing protocols: OSPF, RIPv2, and EIGRP. Each protocol was implemented in its own version of the topology to demonstrate how routing behavior and performance vary across protocols. Key aspects such as route propagation, convergence, and protocol-specific configurations were tested and analyzed in each setup.
